"""Artificial-lift design — ESP sizing and gas-lift (pure numpy/scipy).

Standard textbook artificial-lift design methods (Takacs, *Electrical Submersible Pumps
Manual*; Brown, *The Technology of Artificial Lift*; Economides et al.). Nothing here is
proprietary — these are the canonical design equations every production engineer uses.

Two lift methods are provided:

* **ESP (electrical submersible pump)** — the workhorse for high-rate Permian/GoM oil
  wells. Design flow: (1) compute the **total dynamic head (TDH)** the pump must add to
  move the target rate against the well's hydrostatic + friction + surface back-pressure;
  (2) read **head-per-stage** from a representative single-stage pump performance curve at
  the target rate; (3) divide to get the **stage count**; (4) trim with the **affinity
  laws** to a drive frequency; (5) apply a basic **viscosity correction** to head/efficiency
  and compute brake horsepower. The design is checked against the nodal operating point.
* **Gas lift** — inject gas down the annulus to lighten the tubing column. We sweep
  injection GLR and find the rate gain vs. the nodal operating point, returning the
  injection rate that maximizes (or plateaus) production — the classic gas-lift
  performance curve.

Units oilfield throughout: head ft, rate STB/d (or bpd of total fluid), pressure psia,
power hp, frequency Hz.

Deterministic, no I/O, no bluebonnet dependency. Reuses :mod:`src.nodal` for the
well-system physics so the lift design is consistent with the nodal analysis tab.
